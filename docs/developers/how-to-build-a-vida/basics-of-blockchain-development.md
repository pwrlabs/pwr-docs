# Basics of Blockchain Development

Before diving into building an Verifiable Immutable Data Application (VIDA), it’s crucial to understand some fundamental blockchain concepts. These concepts form the backbone of decentralized systems and are essential for creating and managing VIDAs effectively.

## Addresses: Your Blockchain Identity

An address is a unique alphanumeric string that represents a user or entity on the blockchain. Think of it as your public username or account number.

**Example**: `0x552E02E5B031AF314736AE5F947fAB338992aD04`


### Why is it Important?

Addresses allow users to send and receive data or digital assets securely without revealing personal information. Every transaction on the blockchain is tied to an address, ensuring transparency and traceability.

### How It Works:

Addresses are derived from public keys, which are part of a cryptographic pair (public and private keys). This ensures that only the owner of the corresponding private key can authorize actions associated with the address.

## Wallets: Your Digital Safe

A wallet is a tool that manages your private keys, enabling you to interact with the blockchain securely. It’s like your digital safe, storing the credentials needed to access and use your blockchain address.

### Types of Wallets:

- **Hot Wallets**: Connected to the internet (e.g., browser extensions, mobile apps). Convenient but less secure.
- **Cold Wallets**: Offline storage (e.g., hardware wallets). Highly secure but less accessible.

### Why Do You Need a Wallet?

- To sign transactions (prove ownership of an address).
- To store digital assets like PWR Coins (used for transaction fees).
- To interact with VIDAs by submitting or verifying data on PWR Chain.

### How It Works:

When you create a wallet, it generates a private-public key pair:

- The private key is secret and used to sign transactions.
- The public key is shared openly and used to derive your address.

## Transactions: Recording Actions

A transaction represents an action or request submitted to the blockchain. For example:

- Sending PWR Coins from one address to another.
- Submitting data to an VIDA for processing.

### Why Are Transactions Important?

Transactions are immutable records stored on the blockchain. They ensure transparency, accountability, and trust in decentralized systems.

### Key Components of a Transaction:

- **Sender Address**: The initiator of the action.
- **Receiver Address**: The target of the action (optional).
- **Payload**: Data or instructions tied to the action (e.g., "redeem_points").
- **Signature**: Cryptographic proof that the sender authorized the transaction.

## PWR Chain: The Backbone of VIDAs

PWR Chain is a decentralized ledger that securely records all transactions related to VIDAs. Unlike traditional blockchains, it focuses solely on storing data, while VIDAs handle execution off-chain.

### Why Use PWR Chain?

- Ensures data integrity with immutable records.
- Provides transparency for all actions performed by VIDAs.
- Avoids traditional blockchain bottlenecks by separating execution from consensus.
- Allows deveopment in any coding language.

## Transaction Fees: The Cost of Doing Business

Transaction fees are small payments required to process transactions on the blockchain. They compensate validators for securing the network and recording transactions.

### Why Are Transaction Fees Necessary?

They prevent spam by attaching a cost to every action and ensure that validators are incentivized to maintain network integrity.


## Why Understanding These Concepts Matters

If you want to build a decentralized VIDA, you must grasp these basics because:

1. Your app will rely on wallets for user authentication and interaction.
2. All actions in your app will be recorded as transactions on PWR Chain.
3. Decentralization ensures your app remains trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof.

Even when building a centralized VIDA, understanding these fundamentals is essential to help you build an VIDA.

By mastering these foundational ideas, you’ll be ready to create powerful applications that leverage blockchain’s unique strengths while remaining accessible to users worldwide.
