# What is a Decentralized Application?

When building on a blockchain, developers often try to build decentralized applications, and not centralized ones. Decentralized applications are applications that are not controlled by any single party and doesn't rely nor need to rely on any single party to run it.

In other words, a decentralized application, similarly to the blockchain it is built on, serves the purpose it was built for in a verifiably honest manner and with no points of control or attack. It's a force of nature, no one can control it or stop it.

## Key Components of a Decentralized Application

Different decentralized applications serve different purposes and as such they might have different rules. But there are 2 key components that all decentralized applications have, and without them they are not decentralized.

- **Unified Set of Rules**: A decentralized application is an app that anyone can run.
- **Unified Set of Data**.

**Applications of decentralized applications are many and include:**

- Crypto Currencies.
- Decentralized P2P Messaging.
- Robust, cost-effective decentralized finance: Applications such as FOREX trading can enjoy instant settlements.
- Decentralized, private, global, and accessible health records.
- Verifiable online agreements and documents.
- Verifiable online records.
- Cross borders financial records and payments.
- Supply chain management.
- Verifiably honest voting systems.
- Fast, cost effective, and efficient real estate registries.
- Tokenization of real-world assets, and efficient management via decentralized registries.
- Protection of intellectual properties and royalties.
- Verifiable digital identities.
- Education and certification verification. 
- Energy trading. 
- Art and collectibles authentication. 
- Insurance claims processing. 
- Corporate governance voting. 
- Legal industry applications. 
- Verifiable public services and government records.
