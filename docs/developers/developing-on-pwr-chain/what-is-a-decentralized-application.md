# What is a Decentralized Application?

When building on a blockchain, developers often try to build decentralized applications, and not centralized ones. Decentralized applications are applications that are not controlled by any single party and doesn't rely nor need to rely on any single party to run it.

In other words, a decentralized application, similarly to the blockchain it is built on, serves the purpose it was built for in a verifiably honest manner and with no points of control or attack. It's a force of nature, no one can control it or stop it.

## Key Components of a Decentralized Application

Different decentralized applications serve different purposes and as such they might have different rules. But there are 2 key components that all decentralized applications have, and without them they are not decentralized.

- **Unified Set of Rules**: A decentralized application is an app that anyone can run.
- **Unified Set of Data**.

## Why Build DApps on PWR Chain?

PWR Chain is built with a focus on developer accessibility, providing ready-to-use tools, flexible infrastructure, and robust support for multiple programming environments. Whether you're a seasoned blockchain developer or just starting, PWR Chain offers a highly scalable and efficient platform for deploying your decentralized applications.

Key advantages include:

- **Infinite Virtual Machines**: Unlike traditional blockchains with a single virtual machine, PWR Chain allows an infinite number of virtual machines (VMs) to operate on top of the base layer, providing the flexibility to build any type of application without limitations.
- **Separation of Roles**: PWR Chain separates validation from processing, so your DApp can operate independently of other applications on the chain, ensuring performance and security.
- **Instant Finality and High Throughput**: With a transaction speed exceeding 300,000 transactions per second and instant finality, DApps on PWR Chain can handle real-world, high-demand use cases with ease.
- **Developer-Friendly Fee Model**: PWR Chain uses a fixed fee model based on the amount of data processed, eliminating the uncertainty of fluctuating gas fees, making costs predictable and manageable.

## Real-World Use Cases for DApps

The possibilities for DApps are nearly endless. Developers on PWR Chain can create innovative solutions across multiple industries, including:

- **Finance (DeFi)**: Build decentralized financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading platforms.
- **Healthcare**: Develop secure, decentralized health record systems that ensure patient privacy.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Enable transparent and tamper-proof tracking of goods.
- **Voting**: Design verifiable, secure voting systems for both government and corporate governance.
- **Digital Identity**: Create decentralized identity systems that offer privacy and control to users.
- **Art and Collectibles**: Power decentralized marketplaces for art, NFTs, and digital collectibles.
- **Real Estate**: Tokenize real-world assets like property and streamline transactions.
