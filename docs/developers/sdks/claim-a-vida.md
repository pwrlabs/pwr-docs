# Claim a VIDA

In the PWR Chain ecosystem, Verifiable Immutable Data Applications (VIDAs) play a crucial role in enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Each VIDA is identified by a unique ID, known as the VIDA. As a developer, you need to claim a VIDA to indicate that it is being used by your application and to receive certain benefits.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of claiming a VIDA on the PWR Chain using the PWR SDK.

## Understanding VIDAs

A VIDA is a unique identifier that represents a specific Virtual Machine on the PWR Chain. It serves as an address for your application, allowing it to interact with the PWR Chain and other applications.

Claiming a VIDA has the following benefits:

1. **Ownership**: By claiming a VIDA, you establish ownership of that particular VIDA. It informs others that the VIDA is being used by your application and is not available for others to claim.
2. **Transaction Fee Rewards**: When you claim a VIDA, you become eligible to receive 15% of the transaction fees generated by transactions sent to your VIDA. This serves as a reward for developers and helps incentivize the development of dApps on the PWR Chain.

## Claiming a VIDA

To claim a VIDA on the PWR Chain, follow these steps:

1. **Create a PWR Wallet**: If you haven't already, create a PWR wallet that will be used to claim the VIDA. You can refer to the [**Wallets in PWR Chain**](/developers/sdks/wallets-in-pwr-chain) guide for detailed instructions.
2. **Unique VIDA**: Choose a unique VIDA, no one has claimed it.
3. Claim the VIDA: Use the PWR SDK to claim the VIDA by sending a "Claim VIDA" transaction.

        }
    }

Using the wallet's claimVmId method, we claim the VIDA by providing the vida. The SDK will handle the creation and signing of the "Claim VIDA" transaction.

If the transaction is successfully sent, we receive a response containing the transaction hash. Otherwise, we handle the error accordingly.

Once the transaction is confirmed, the VIDA is successfully claimed, and you become the owner of that VIDA. You will start receiving 15% of the transaction fees generated by transactions sent to your VIDA.

## Best Practices for Claiming VIDAs

When claiming VIDAs on the PWR Chain, consider the following best practices:

1. **Choose a Unique VIDA**: Ensure that the VIDA you generate is unique and not already claimed by another application. Collision of VIDAs can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
2. **Secure Your Private Key**: Keep your wallet's private key secure and never share it with anyone.
3. **Monitor Your VIDA**: Regularly monitor your claimed VIDA for any suspicious activities or unauthorized transactions.
4. **Update Your Application**: Keep your application up to date with the latest PWR Chain features and security patches.

By following these best practices and leveraging the PWR SDK's VIDA claiming capabilities, you can securely claim a VIDA for your application on the PWR Chain, establish ownership, and receive transaction fee rewards for your dApp's usage.
