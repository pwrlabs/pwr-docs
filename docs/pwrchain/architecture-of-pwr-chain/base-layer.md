# Base Layer

Foundational component designed to support high-performance applications while maintaining security and decentralization.

## What is the Base Layer in PWR Chain? 

[PWR Chain](/pwrchain/overview/) is a revolutionary blockchain infrastructure that focuses on enhancing the scalability, interoperability, and efficiency of decentralized applications. At its core, the Base Layer is a decentralized blockchain dedicated to managing consensus, handling transactions, organizing blocks, and ensuring network security. This layer is designed to perform these functions without the burden of processing smart contracts or other smart applications, thereby maintaining high throughput and security.

## How Does It Work?

The Base Layer operates primarily through [validator nodes](/pwrchain/architecture-of-pwr-chain/nodes-and-their-roles/validator-nodes/about), which are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks. These nodes are crucial in maintaining the integrity and continuity of the blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchains where smart contracts are processed at the base layer, PWR Chain ensures that these operations are handled above the base layer, and any application built on PWR Chain can receive transactions and info through independent [RPC nodes](/pwrchain/architecture-of-pwr-chain/nodes-and-their-roles/rpc-nodes/about) without bothering the base layer, allowing for an infinite number of [virtual machines](/) and [applications](/) to run without affecting the core networkâ€™s performance.
