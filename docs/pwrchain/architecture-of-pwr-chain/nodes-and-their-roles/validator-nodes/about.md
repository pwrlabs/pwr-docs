# About Validator Nodes

## What are Validator Nodes?

Validator nodes are crucial components of the [PWR Chain](/pwrchain/overview/)’s infrastructure. They play a key role in maintaining the blockchain’s integrity, security, and continuity. Validator nodes are responsible for validating transactions, proposing new blocks, and participating in the consensus process to ensure each transaction is legitimate and that blocks are added to the blockchain correctly.

## How Do Validator Nodes Work?

- **Transaction Validation**: Validator nodes receive transactions from users. Each transaction is thoroughly checked for its validity — this includes verifying digital signatures, ensuring transaction integrity, and confirming that users have the necessary funds.
- **Block Proposal**: Once transactions are validated, they are grouped into blocks by the validator nodes. A single node, chosen according to the blockchain’s consensus rules, proposes the new block to the network.
- **Consensus Formation**: Validator nodes communicate with each other to agree on the validity of the proposed block. This process involves a consensus algorithm specific to PWR Chain, which ensures that all active validator nodes agree on the current state of the blockchain ledger.
- **Block Addition**: After reaching consensus, the block is officially added to the blockchain. This final step effectively updates the blockchain with all the new transactions included in the block.

## Role in the Network

- **Consensus Building**: Validator nodes propose and validate new blocks, ensuring transactions are legitimate and agreed upon by a majority.
- **Block Creation**: They gather and process transactions to create new blocks.
- **Network Security**: Validator nodes prevent fraudulent activities.
- **Decentralized Management**: Operating in a distributed manner, they prevent any single point of failure.
- **Finality**: They ensure transactions are permanently recorded with instant finality.
- **Governance Participation**: Validator nodes also have a role in governance decisions, influencing network upgrades and protocol changes.
