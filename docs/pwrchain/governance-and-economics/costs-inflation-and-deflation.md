# Costs, Inflation & Deflation

PWR Chain is engineered for exceptional cost efficiency, minimizing barriers to network participation.  
Validator nodes operate on modest hardware requirements:  
**1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, a 100GB NVME SSD** for state management, and **HDD storage** for block history.  
These specifications make PWR Chain one of the most affordable blockchains to run, democratizing access to network validation.

To ensure long-term network sustainability and validator incentives, PWR Chain implements a **2% annual inflation rate**. However, this rate is applied only to the **initial supply of 1 billion PWR Coins**, meaning that the absolute number of new coins issued remains constant each year. As the total supply grows over time, the **relative inflation rate decreases**, ensuring a deflationary effect.

### Key properties of the inflation model:

- **Fixed at 20 million PWR per year** (2% of 1 billion).
- **Not subject to change by validators**—modifying the inflation rate would require a hard fork.
- **Encourages staking participation** while maintaining predictable supply dynamics.

This structure ensures a balanced approach where validators are incentivized, but inflationary pressure decreases as adoption increases.

This inflation is dynamically distributed to delegators, with yields inversely proportional to the percentage of circulating supply staked:

- **10% Staked:** Delegators earn up to **20% APY** (2% inflation ÷ 10% staked × 100).
- **20% Staked:** Yields drop to **10% APY** (2% ÷ 20% × 100).
- **50% Staked:** Yields reach **4% APY** (2% ÷ 50% × 100).
- **100% Staked:** Yields stabilize at **2% APY** (2% ÷ 100% × 100).

This mechanism achieves two critical goals:

1. **Security Incentives**: When staking rates are low, high APY attracts delegators, strengthening network decentralization.
2. **Economic Flexibility**: As staking participation grows, lower yields encourage holders to allocate coins elsewhere—such as DeFi protocols, governance, or VIDA operations—optimizing capital utilization without compromising security.

### Deflationary Fee Burning

In addition to the fixed inflation model, PWR Chain incorporates a **deflationary mechanism** through **fee burning**.

- **10% of all transaction fees are permanently burned**, reducing the circulating supply over time.
- **Validators can vote to adjust the burn percentage**, allowing governance to fine-tune network economics as needed.

By balancing **fixed inflation with variable fee burning**, PWR Chain creates a dynamic yet controlled monetary policy designed for long-term sustainability.
