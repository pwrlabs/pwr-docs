# How Decisions are Made

Decision-making on the PWR Chain will be governed by a decentralized and participatory governance model that empowers stakeholders to shape the future of the network. The governance process is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and aligned with the interests of the PWR Chain community.

## Proposal Creation

- Open Proposal Submission: Anyone in the PWR Chain community can create proposals for changes, upgrades, or improvements to the PWR Chain protocol. This includes PWR token holders, developers, and other stakeholders. Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, such as parameter adjustments, feature implementations, or changes to the governance process itself.
- Proposal Lifetime: Each proposal will have a maximum lifetime of 40 days. Within this period, the proposal will be open for discussion, deliberation, and voting by the validators. If a proposal does not reach a conclusion within its lifetime, it will automatically expire.

## Voting Process

- **Validator Voting**: Voting on proposals is exclusively done by the validator nodes on the PWR Chain. Validators are responsible for reviewing, discussing, and casting their votes on the proposals submitted by the community.
- **Voting Power**: The voting power of each validator is determined by the total amount of PWR they have staked, which includes both their personal stake and the stake delegated to them by other PWR holders. The higher the total stake of a validator, the greater their voting power and influence on the outcome of a proposal.
- **Voting Platform**: In the very near future, PWR Chain will have a dedicated website or platform where validators can view, discuss, and vote on proposals. This platform will provide a user-friendly interface for validators to engage in the governance process.
- **Threshold for Approval**: For a proposal to be approved and implemented, it must achieve a threshold of 2/3 of the total voting power on the network. This threshold is consistent across proposals, reflecting the significance and impact of governance decisions within the PWR Chain community.

## Implementation of Approved Proposals

- **Auto Execution**: Many proposals such as parameter adjustments for fees, consensus, and others have executions auto built into the PWR Chain and will be auto executed once a proposal gets enough votes,
- **Manual Execution**: If a proposal requires significant changes that can't be auto executed, it will be implemented by the PWR Chain development team or others. Once the new update is ready, another proposal will be carried out to agree on a release date, and double check that all validators still agree to the original proposal.
- **Monitoring and Review**: After the implementation of a proposal, the PWR Chain community will monitor its effects and review its outcomes. If necessary, further adjustments or iterations can be proposed and voted upon to refine the implemented changes.

The PWR Chain governance model aims to create a balanced decision-making process that combines open participation from the community in proposal creation with the security and stake-weighted voting of validators. By empowering validators with voting rights proportional to their total stake, PWR Chain ensures that decisions are made by those with a significant vested interest in the long-term success and security of the network.
