# How Decisions are Made

In the PWR Chain ecosystem, validators and delegators play crucial roles in ensuring the security, stability, and governance of the network. Their participation and collaboration are essential for the smooth operation and decision-making processes of the PWR Chain.

## Validators

- **Block Production**: Validators are responsible for producing and validating blocks on the PWR Chain. They participate in the consensus process, verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Validators ensure the integrity and security of the network by following the consensus rules and maintaining high uptime and performance.
- **Governance Participation**: Validators actively participate in the governance of the PWR Chain. They have the authority to vote on proposals submitted by the community, using their voting power proportional to their total stake (personal stake + delegated stake). Validators review, discuss, and make decisions on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and other important matters that shape the future of the network.

## Delegators

- **Staking**: Delegators are PWR token holders who delegate their tokens to validators. By delegating their tokens, delegators contribute to the security and decentralization of the network without the need to run a validator node themselves. Delegators can choose which validators to delegate their tokens to based on factors such as reputation, performance, and commission fees.
- **Governance Participation**: Although delegators do not have direct voting power in the governance process, they can influence the decision-making by carefully selecting the validators they delegate to. Delegators can assess the voting history and alignment of validators with their own preferences and values. By delegating to validators that align with their interests, delegators indirectly participate in the governance of the PWR Chain.

## Collaboration and Accountability

Validators and delegators form a symbiotic relationship in the PWR Chain ecosystem. Validators provide the infrastructure and services necessary for the network's operation, while delegators contribute to the security and decentralization by staking their tokens.

Transparency and accountability are key aspects of this relationship. Validators are expected to maintain high standards of performance, security, and ethical behavior. They should communicate transparently with their delegators about their operations, commission fees, and any changes that may impact the delegators' interests.

Delegators, in turn, have the responsibility to conduct due diligence when selecting validators, monitoring their performance, and making informed decisions about their delegations. They should actively engage with the validators they have delegated to, provide feedback, and hold them accountable for their actions.

Together, validators and delegators contribute to the overall health, security, and growth of the PWR Chain network. Their active participation and alignment of interests are essential for the long-term success and sustainability of the ecosystem.
