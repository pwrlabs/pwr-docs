# Handler Node

Handler nodes are an essential component of the PWR Chain ecosystem, serving as intermediaries between the PWR Chain and virtual machines (VMs) or decentralized applications (dApps).

## Key Responsibilities

- Data Retrieval: Handler nodes fetch data from the PWR Chain and provide it to the VMs or dApps they serve.
- Data Filtering: Handler nodes filter and process the retrieved data, ensuring that only relevant and necessary information is passed to the VMs or dApps.
- Data Formatting: Handler nodes transform the data into a format compatible with the specific requirements of the VMs or dApps.

## Benefits

- Efficiency: Handler nodes optimize the data flow between the PWR Chain and VMs/dApps, reducing the processing burden on the VMs/dApps and improving overall performance.
- Compatibility: By adapting data formats and handling transaction processing, handler nodes enable seamless integration of VMs/dApps with the PWR Chain, regardless of their specific requirements or architectures.
- Scalability: Handler nodes can be deployed in a distributed manner, allowing for the handling of high volumes of data and transactions, ensuring the scalability of the PWR Chain ecosystem.

## Integration with PWR Chain

- Handler nodes are often customized and integrated into the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes of VMs/dApps, providing a unified interface for interaction with the PWR Chain.
- This integration simplifies the development and deployment of VMs/dApps on the PWR Chain, as developers can focus on their core functionality while relying on the handler nodes for data management and transaction processing.

## Customization and Flexibility

- Handler nodes can be customized to cater to the specific needs of different VMs/dApps, supporting various data formats, filtering criteria, and transaction validation rules.
- This flexibility allows for the accommodation of a wide range of use cases and enables the PWR Chain to support a diverse ecosystem of VMs/dApps.
