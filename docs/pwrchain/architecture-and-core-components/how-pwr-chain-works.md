# How PWR Chain Works

Foundational component designed to support high-performance applications while maintaining security and decentralization.

## Base Layer

[PWR Chain](/pwrchain/overview/) is a revolutionary blockchain infrastructure that focuses on enhancing the scalability, interoperability, and efficiency of decentralized applications. At its core, the Base Layer is a decentralized blockchain dedicated to managing consensus, handling transactions, organizing blocks, and ensuring network security. This layer is designed to perform these functions without the burden of processing smart contracts or other smart applications, thereby maintaining high throughput and security.

### How Does It Work?

The Base Layer operates primarily through [validator nodes](/pwrchain/architecture-and-core-components/nodes-and-their-roles/validator-node), which are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks. These nodes are crucial in maintaining the integrity and continuity of the blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchains where smart contracts are processed at the base layer, PWR Chain ensures that these operations are handled above the base layer, and any application built on PWR Chain can receive transactions and info through independent [RPC nodes](/pwrchain/architecture-and-core-components/nodes-and-their-roles/rpc-node) without bothering the base layer, allowing for an infinite number of [virtual machines](/) and [applications](/) to run without affecting the core network’s performance.

## Processing Layer 

The processing layer in PWR Chain is positioned above the base layer and consists of a diverse array of virtual machines (VMs) and software applications. This layer is dynamic and is designed to efficiently execute the specific tasks assigned to each VM or application without interfering with the operations of the base layer.

### How Does It Work?

The processing layer of PWR Chain functions through a highly organized and efficient system that enables distinct operational environments for various virtual machines (VMs) and software applications. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Unique Identifiers for VMs/Applications**: Each virtual machine or application on the PWR Chain is assigned a unique identifier (ID). This ID system is crucial for directing transactions to the correct recipient within the processing layer.
2. **Transaction Routing**: When a user initiates a transaction, they must specify the ID of the VM or application they intend to interact with. This ensures that transactions are not just processed generically across the entire network but are directed and executed in the context of the intended VM or application.
3. **Independent State Management**: Unlike traditional blockchains where all operations might impact the main blockchain's state, the processing layer on PWR Chain allows each VM and application to maintain its own state. This separation ensures that activities within one VM do not affect another, leading to optimized performance and enhanced security.
4. **Dedicated Processing**: By having separate states, each VM or application can process transactions and execute functions without overloading the base layer of the blockchain. This setup not only increases efficiency but also allows for scalability, as each VM can operate independently without causing delays or requiring excessive processing power from the base layer.
5. **Enhanced Security and Efficiency**: This architecture minimizes risks associated with centralized processing and avoids the bottlenecks that can occur when a single layer is responsible for all operations. The separate states also prevent issues in one VM from affecting others, enhancing the robustness of the overall network.
6. **Direct Communication and Interaction**: In the PWR Chain architecture, virtual machines (VMs) and applications can interact seamlessly with the base layer as well as with each other when necessary. This interaction is facilitated through transactions, which are the primary mode of communication within the network.

The design of the processing layer in PWR Chain effectively allows it to handle a high volume of transactions and diverse operations, catering to specific needs without compromising the performance and security of the base layer. This setup is particularly advantageous for complex ecosystems involving multiple decentralized applications and services.
