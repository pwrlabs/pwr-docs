# Key Terms

Glossary of terms that will be used throughout the documentation

- **PWR**: A shortcut for Power Blockchain. It is the blockchain we document and introduce in these documentation articles.

- **Base Layer**: The foundational layer of PWR Blockchain dedicated to managing consensus, handling transactions, organizing blocks, and ensuring network security without processing smart contracts or applications.

- **Verifiable Immutable Data Applications (VIDAs)**: is a self-contained software program that leverages PWR Chainâ€™s immutable transaction ledger to operate transparently, securely, and at scale.

- **Software Applications**: Applications built on PWR Chain using established programming languages, capable of sophisticated operations, including automation and internet interaction, functioning beyond the traditional constraints of smart contracts.

- **Validator Nodes**: Nodes that propose and reach consensus on new blocks within the PWR Chain, playing a crucial role in maintaining the operational continuity and security of the network.

- **Conduit Nodes**: Nodes that facilitate interoperability between various VMs and the PWR base layer by acting as message relaying nodes. They capture and submit VM-generated transactions to the base layer.

- **Wrapper Nodes**: Nodes that integrate different wallets with the VMs on PWR Chain, handling transactions and ensuring seamless processing while maintaining security through original signature authentication.

- **Handler Nodes**: Intermediate nodes that manage the interaction between the PWR Chain and VMs by sorting and checking data before it reaches the VMs, mostly associated with RPC nodes of these VMs.

- **RPC Nodes**: Nodes that specialize in data retrieval, synchronizing with the blockchain to provide historical and real-time data of the PWR Chain ecosystem to users and applications.

- **MHBS (Multi Hash Based Signatures)**: A signature algorithm used on PWR Chain, offering enhanced security against quantum attacks and high throughput.

- **SNT (Simple Native Transactions)**: A transaction encoding and decoding protocol on PWR Chain designed for efficiency, allowing quick processing of large volumes of transactions.

- **EWER (Easy Write Easy Read)**: A block encoding and decoding protocol that optimizes the speed and accuracy of writing and reading blockchain data on PWR Chain.

- **DPOP (Delegated Proof of Power)**: A unique consensus mechanism on PWR Chain that democratizes the block proposal process by ensuring equitable participation and reward distribution among validators.

- **Guardians**: A security feature on PWR Chain allowing users to assign trusted entities to approve transactions, enhancing security, especially in compromised situations. It's like on-chain 2fa.

- **Transaction Fee**: A fee paid in $PWR by users when sending transactions to the PWR Chain. The fee is proportional to the size of the transaction.
