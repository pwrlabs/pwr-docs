# RPC Node

## What are RPC Nodes?

RPC Nodes in the [PWR Chain](/pwrchain/overview/) are crucial components designed to facilitate communication between the blockchain and its users or applications. They serve as the access points for sending queries or transactions to the blockchain and receiving data back. Essentially, RPC Nodes are the interface through which external parties interact with the blockchain's data and functionalities.

## Key Roles and Functions

- **Data Retrieval**: RPC Nodes handle requests for data retrieval from the blockchain, such as checking account balances, transaction histories, or the state of the blockchain. They provide the necessary interface for applications and users to query blockchain data.
- **Transaction Submission**: They also manage the submission of transactions to the blockchain. Users and applications send their transactions to an RPC Node, which then forwards them to the network for processing and inclusion in the blockchain.
- **Network Interaction**: RPC Nodes facilitate broader network interactions, such as deploying smart contracts or executing contract functions. They process commands and code executions requested by users and developers.

## Importance in the Network

- **User Accessibility**: RPC Nodes make the blockchain accessible to users and developers, allowing for easy interaction with the network without needing to run a full node.
- **Efficiency and Scalability**: By handling a large volume of queries and transactions, RPC Nodes help distribute the computational load and enhance the overall efficiency and scalability of the blockchain.
- **Real-Time Data Access**: They provide real-time access to blockchain data, which is crucial for applications that rely on up-to-the-minute accuracy, such as trading platforms or financial services.
