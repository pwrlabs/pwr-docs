# Security

PWR Chain is engineered to provide robust security across its consensus mechanism, transaction validation, and decentralized application layer. By integrating NIST-standardized Post-Quantum cryptography, enhancing Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), and enforcing strict economic incentives, PWR Chain ensures resilience against both current and future threats.

## Consensus Security: Quantum-Resistant Tendermint

PWR Chain modifies the Tendermint BFT protocol to address quantum computing risks and centralization pressures:

- **NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Validator Signatures**:
Replaces classical Ed25519 with Falcon, a NIST-standardized post-quantum secure signature scheme. This ensures validator votes and block proposals remain secure against quantum attacks.

- **Instant Finality**:
Inherits Tendermint’s deterministic finality—blocks are irreversibly finalized in seconds, eliminating reorg risks.

- **Decentralized Block Production**:
Implements an equal chances model for validators, where block creation opportunities are distributed equally among active validators, regardless of stake size. This prevents stake concentration and promotes long-term decentralization.

## Wallet & Address Security

PWR Chain prioritizes both security and usability in its wallet and address system. Here are the key features:

1. **Ethereum-Compatible Addresses**: PWR Chain uses the standard Ethereum address format, ensuring easy integration with existing exchanges, wallets, and infrastructure.
2. **Quantum Resistance**: Despite their familiar format, PWR Chain addresses are quantum-secure. The use of Falcon for signatures protects against quantum threats.
3. **Collision Resistance**: Despite the short address format of only 20 bytes, every address in PWR Chain is linked to one and only one public key once it's used. Providing protection against address collision attacks. 
4. **Easy Integration**: The use of standard Ethereum-format addresses simplifies the process of listing PWR Coin on exchanges and integrating with self-custody wallets, enhancing accessibility for users.

By combining quantum security with user-friendly design, PWR Chain offers a robust and accessible address system that's ready for both current and future cryptographic challenges.

## Transaction Security: Quantum-Resistant Signatures

Every transaction on PWR Chain is secured by **Falcon signatures**, ensuring:

- **Future-Proofing**: Resistant to Shor’s algorithm and other quantum decryption methods.
- **Efficiency**: Single CPU core verifies 20k–40k signatures/second, balancing security with scalability.
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: All transactions are immutably timestamped on-chain, creating an auditable history resistant to alteration.

## Additional Safeguards

**Economic Security**

- **Staking Slashing**: Validators and Conduit Nodes risk losing staked PWR Coin for malicious actions (e.g., double-signing).
- **Inflation-Driven Incentives**: A 2% annual inflation rate rewards honest staking, dynamically adjusting yields to maintain network participation.

**VIDA Security**

- **VIDA Replayability**: Anyone can independently verify VIDA outputs by reprocessing on-chain transaction logs, eliminating reliance on trusted intermediaries.
- **Cross-Validation**: Optional consensus among VIDA Execution Instances to detect and flag discrepancies in state transitions.

**Conduit Node Governance**

- **Anti-Collusion Rules**: Customizable staking requirements, geographic distribution, and reputation systems for Conduit Nodes.
- **Transparent Voting**: All cross-VIDA communication votes are recorded on-chain for public audit.

## Why PWR Chain’s Security Model Stands Out

| Aspect              | Traditional Chains                | PWR Chain                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Quantum Resistance** | Relies on ECDSA/Ed25519        | **Falcon** (NIST-standard)  |
| **Finality**         | Probabilistic (e.g., PoW)       | **Instant** (BFT-based)     |
| **Decentralization** | Stake-weighted validation      | **Equal chances** + slashing |

By unifying quantum-resistant cryptography, decentralized consensus, and trustless verification, PWR Chain delivers enterprise-grade security without compromising scalability or accessibility. Its layered defenses ensure resilience against evolving threats while maintaining the agility required for mainstream adoption.
