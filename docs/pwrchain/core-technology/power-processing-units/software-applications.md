# Software Applications

On the PWR Chain, developers have the unprecedented freedom to build not only virtual machines and smart contracts but also software applications. This unique capability sets PWR Chain apart from other blockchain platforms, as it allows for the creation of centralized or decentralized applications using any coding language.

## Characteristics of Software Applications

Software applications built on the PWR Chain offer several advantages over traditional smart contracts:

1. **Coding Language Flexibility**: Unlike smart contracts that often use niche languages with limited features, software applications on PWR Chain can be developed using established and feature-rich languages such as Java, C#, Python, and more. This allows for more advanced and complex development.
2. **Unrestricted Processing Power**: Smart contracts run on a shared virtual machine alongside numerous other contracts, leading to limitations on computational usage to protect the VM. In contrast, software applications on PWR Chain are essentially their own dedicated VMs, allowing developers to utilize as much processing power as needed without restrictions.
3. **Automation Capabilities**: While smart contracts require external triggers to initiate operations, software applications on PWR Chain can be fully automated. With unrestricted processing power, these applications can have always-running processes and execute operations based on various conditions, ensuring a consistent state across all participants.
4. **Access to Algorithms and Protocols**: Smart contracts have limited access to algorithms, but software applications on PWR Chain can leverage all existing and new algorithms and protocols through tools, libraries, or direct coding. This opens up a vast array of possibilities limited only by the developer's imagination and technical abilities.
5. **Internet Connectivity**: Unlike smart contracts, software applications on PWR Chain can interact with the internet, reading data from online sources and even sending data when set up correctly. This enables smooth multi-chain interaction, allowing applications to communicate with other blockchains seamlessly.

## How Software Applications Work on PWR Chain

Software applications on PWR Chain exist as processing units, separate from the blockchain's validation process. When a user interacts with a software application, they submit their transaction directly to the PWR Chain base layer. Once the transaction is included in a block, it is captured and processed by the software application.

To remove unnecessary processing load from virtual machines, users specify to which application their transaction is meant, allowing for fast and efficient capturing and sorting of transactions.

## User Experience

Users can easily interact with these applications through a number of methods:

1. **PWR Browser Wallet**: This wallet enables users to approve and submit transactions to the blockchain seamlessly.
2. **Built-in Application Wallets**: Some applications may feature integrated wallets, providing a seamless user experience where users don't need to be aware that the application is built on a blockchain or that a wallet is sending transactions behind the scenes.
3. **Wrapper Nodes**: Software applications can also utilize wrapper nodes to allow users to interact with them through any wallet or interface, such as Metamask, TrustWallet, Phantom, and others. These nodes serve as a link between the users and the applications, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of wallets and interfaces.

The flexibility and capabilities of software applications on PWR Chain enable developers to deliver an unparalleled user experience, making it easy for users to interact with these applications using their preferred methods.

## State Verification

There are two components needed to construct and validate the state of an application:

- The rules of the application (How the application processes transactions and their content).
- The blocks and the transactions they hold.

PWR Chain provides these blocks and transactions to any and all applications, and each application would be public. This allows anyone to reconstruct and validate the state of these applications by simply running them, fetching the transactions from PWR Chain, and processing them.

## Scalability

PWR Chain's unique architecture, which separates the blockchain operations from application processing, allows for exceptional scalability. By offloading the application execution, the base layer of PWR Chain can focus on its core functions, such as consensus, security, and transaction processing. This separation enables the applications to scale independently without impacting the performance of the base layer.

Since the applications do not need to concern themselves with blockchain operations and can dedicate their resources to processing transactions, they can achieve significant scalability. If implemented correctly, the applications can scale to match the throughput of the base layer, which is capable of handling up to 300,000 transactions per second (TPS).

The parallel execution of multiple applications further enhances the scalability of the PWR Chain. Each application can process transactions simultaneously, allowing for a high degree of concurrency and efficient utilization of resources. This parallel processing capability enables PWR Chain to support a vast number of decentralized applications and users without compromising performance.
